### Would you be interested in designing open-source UI components for Vue/React (the graphical part)?

Hi, I'm an experienced frontend developer and I'd like to join with a skilled UI designer to build a Vue (and maybe React in future) UI open-source library.
I'd like to create the library including the open-sourced graphic design itself so anyone could take our stuff and build upon it.

I'm looking for someone with experience in building rich UI, but of course we must start to build on basics - inputs, checkboxes, buttons, etc. and we will see how far we get.

Of course I don't expect us to sit and build it in a week, it will be more a process taking its time (a year, if needed). We must pay our bills first.

Are you interested?
